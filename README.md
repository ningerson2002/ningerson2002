`Digital Craftsman`

I'm a computer science student at Allegheny College learning to build my version of the digital world one step at a
time. All of my projects have been built from a single idea or question I've asked myself. "I wonder if you could make a
functional bank account system in Python," or "how would I go about creating a password generator and manager?" which
evolved into "how would I develop a password authentication system in Python?" These experiences have given me tools
that I can use in my every day life; from problem-solving to conceptualizing.

<h3>
🧑‍💻 Nic's Coding Journey
</h3>
</summary>
My coding journey started when I dabbled in video game development using C#, but eventually I forgot about it. However, I kept my interest in coding alive by taking various Python lessons on freeCodeCamp.
Between 2019 and 2021, I took a break from coding and enrolled in Allegheny College. It wasn't until my Fall semester when I took a Computational Expression course that I fell in love with coding again.
Since then, I have taken multiple courses in the college curriculum, with a focus on Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics. I am currently expanding my skills in these areas and I'm excited to see where my coding journey takes me next.
